                    Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and related technologies will have powerful impacts on learning not only through direct supports for students, 
                    but also by empowering educators to be more adaptive to learner needs and less consumed by routine, repetitive tasks. 
                    There is little question that we need innovative approaches in education and that AI will be a major new capability that allows innovation.

                            During the Disease outbreak and in the future, there will be a lot of learning.  
                            Since the pandemic has interrupted global schooling, remote learning has emerged as a viable option, 
                            depending on machine learning to accomplish its goals.
                            The detailed assessment of AI in education, the use of AI in education, typical learning in the pandemic era, 
                            and the role of AI disease outbreak learning are all important for both current and future residents. 
                            While statistical methods and automated based on learning jobs that are smarter than normal continue to be important, learning is becoming more automated.  
                            It helps individuals to be more concentrated on their learning opportunities and to recognize when they do not grasp a subject completely.  
                            First and foremost, the instructors provide valuable assistance throughout the assessment process of student learning outcomes.

                        <p class="description"> <br>
                            According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 2.2 billion people around the world have some form of vision disability or blindness.
                            For students, mathematical instruction and assessment, especially online, can pose additional access barriers. 
                            NWEA — a not-for-profit, research and educational services provider serving K-12 students —
                            is working to make middle school mathematics assessments more accessible for students with vision disabilities using AI technology. 
                            The project aims to offer more educational opportunities and address unmet accommodation needs that can currently exclude students 
                            with disabilities from higher-level mathematics as well as paths to advanced degrees and Science, 
                            Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) - related careers.

                        The recent AIEd literature has examined AI agents playing 13 roles across the four key educational domains of learning, teaching, assessment, and administration, and it has examined seven learning outcomes for students and teachers. 
                        <br>Four key educational domains:
                        <br>•  Learning: The technologies have been applied to assigning tasks based on individual competence, providing human–machine conversations, analyzing students' work for feedback, and increasing adaptability and interactivity in digital environments. 
                        <br>•  Teaching: AIEd has been applied to providing adaptive teaching strategies, enhancing teachers' ability to teach, and supporting teachers' professional development. 
                        <br>•  Assessment: The technologies have been applied to support teachers' work on assessment by providing automatic marking and predicting students' performance. 
                        <br>•  Administration: AIEd has been used for improving the performance of management platforms, providing convenient and personalized services (non-academic and academic), and supporting educational decision-making with evidence.

                            With the rapid technological development of society brought on by AI, 
                            the demand for AI-literate workers will increase in the future. 
                            It is critical to develop the next generation's AI competencies and educate them about how to work with and use AI. 
                            Previous studies on AI were predominantly focused on secondary and university education. 
                            The employment of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was proven to be helpful in assisting young children in grasping AI principles,

                            Riiid, a leading provider of AI-powered education solutions and member company of Born2Global Centre, 
                            has announced the launch of R.test, an AI-powered Platform designed to help students prepare for standardized tests, 
                            including the digital SAT and ACT. With R.test, 
                            students can predict test scores with high accuracy in only a quarter of the time it takes to complete full mock tests. 
                            "Our technology makes assessments more adaptive, accessible, and reliable," said Y.J. Jang, founder of Riiid. 
                            "R.test is an AI-powered diagnostic test platform that quickly evaluates learners' test preparedness." 
                            R.test is designed to increase the efficiency of standardized test prep with just 30 questions, giving students a fast and accurate assessment of their knowledge and test-taking strategy. 
                            By drilling with R.test, students can quickly improve their predicted test scores, employing 10 different types of insights provided in the AI analysis. 
                            Currently available for the SAT and ACT, R.test will soon be available for other standardized tests.
