            <p class="title">Common Misconceptions about AI</p>
            <div class="content">
                <strong>1. AI aims to explain how the brain works?</strong><br>
                <p class="text">
                No, because brains occur only in living (biological) beings and not in artificial machines. 
                Instead, fields studying the molecular biological mechanisms of natural brains are neuroscience and neurobiology. <br><br>
                <strong>2. AI methods work similar to the brain?</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                No, this is not true; even if the most popular methods of AI are called neural networks which are inspired by biological brains. 
                Importantly, despite the name “neural network” such models do not present physiological neural models because neither the model 
                of a neuron nor the connectivity between the neurons in neural networks is biologically plausible nor realistic. AI cannot 
                understand or make sense of its environment, nor can it truly “learn” from its environment in the way humans can. <br><br>
                <strong>3. AI is 100% objective?</strong><br>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                Technically it could be. An AI system can only be as good as its inputs. If you can clear your training dataset of conscious 
                and unconscious assumptions about race, gender, or other ideological concepts, you can create an AI system that makes unbiased 
                decisions based on the data. However, in the real world, it's difficult to achieve 100% objective.

            <p class="title">AI Principles</p>
            <p class="sub-title">AI can provide new ways of approaching problems and meaningfully improve people’s lives.
                But it needs to be driven by ethical principles, put people first and do good for the society and earth.

            <div class="content">
                <strong>1. Inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being</strong><br>
                <p class="text">
                "Stakeholders should proactively engage in responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI in pursuit of beneficial outcomes for 
                people and the planet, such as augmenting human capabilities and enhancing creativity, advancing inclusion of underrepresented 
                populations, reducing economic, social, gender and other inequalities, and protecting natural environments, thus invigorating 
                inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being." <br><br>
                </p>

                <strong>2. Human-centred values and fairness</strong><br>
                <p class="text">
                    "AI actors should respect the rule of law, human rights and democratic values, throughout the AI system lifecycle. 
                    These include <u>freedom, dignity and autonomy, privacy and data protection, non-discrimination and equality, diversity, 
                    fairness, social justice, and internationally recognised labour rights</u>.To this end, AI actors should implement 
                    mechanisms and safeguards, such as capacity for human determination, that are appropriate to the context and consistent 
                    with the state of art."
                </p>

                <strong>3. Transparency and explainability</strong><br>
                <p class="text">
                    "AI Actors should commit to transparency and responsible disclosure regarding AI systems. 
                    to foster a general understanding of AI systems,
                    - to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems, including in the workplace
                    - to enable those affected by an AI system to understand the outcome
                    - to enable those adversely affected by an AI system to challenge its outcome based on plain and easy-to-understand information on the factors"
                </p>

                <strong>4. Robustness, security and safety</strong><br>
                <p class="text">
                    "AI systems should be robust, secure and safe throughout their entire lifecycle so that, in conditions of normal use, 
                    foreseeable use or misuse, or other adverse conditions, they function appropriately and do not pose unreasonable safety risk."
                </p>

                <strong>5. Accountability</strong><br>
                <p class="text">
                    "I actors should be accountable for the proper functioning of AI systems and for the respect of the above principles, based on their roles, 
                    the context, and consistent with the state of art."
