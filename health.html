                        <p class="description"> <br>In Europe, around 1 million prostate biopsies are carried out each year. Biopsy is still 
                            affected by diagnostic errors between 30% and 50%. The main sources of error are target 
                            detection and needle insertion: both operator dependent! This product aims to radically improve 
                            the clinical outcome in needle based prostate biopsy procedures by using AI and robotics, 
                            turning an operator-dependent procedure into a safe, accurate, and repeatable robot-assisted

                    <p class="description"> <br>
                        Biological age, distinct from an individual’s chronological age, has been studied extensively through predictive aging clocks. However, 
                        these clocks have limited accuracy in short time-scales. Deep learning approaches on imaging datasets of the eye have proven powerful 
                        for a variety of quantitative phenotype inference and provide an opportunity to explore organismal aging and tissue health.

                        Photographs of the external eye were recently shown to reveal signs of diabetic retinal disease and elevated glycated haemoglobin. 
                        This study aimed to test the hypothesis that external eye photographs contain information about additional systemic medical conditions.<br>
                        We developed a deep learning system (DLS) that takes external eye photographs as input and predicts 
                        systemic parameters. This DLS was trained using 123 130 images from 38 398 patients with diabetes 
                        undergoing diabetic eye screening in 11 sites. Evaluation focused on nine prespecified systemic parameters 
                        and leveraged three validation sets (A, B, C) spanning 25 510 patients with and without diabetes undergoing eye screening in three independent 
                        sites. We compared performance against...

                    <p class="description"> <br> 
                        We propose a novel formulation of the triplet objective function that improves metric learning without additional sample mining or overhead costs. 
                        Our approach aims to explicitly regularize the distance between the positive and negative samples in a triplet with respect to the anchor-negative 
                        distance. As an initial validation, we show that our method (called No Pairs Left Behind [NPLB]) improves upon the traditional and current 
                        state-of-the-art triplet objective formulations on standard benchmark datasets. ...
