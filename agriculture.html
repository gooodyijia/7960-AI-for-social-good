                <p class='upper-text2'>AI systems are helping to improve the overall harvest quality and accuracy – known as precision agriculture. 
                    AI technology helps in detecting disease in plants, pests and poor nutrition of farms. 
                    AI sensors can detect and target weeds and then decide which herbicide to apply within the region.
                    AI in agriculture not only assists farmers in automating their agricultural operations, 
                    but also changes to precision cultivation for improved crop output and quality while using less resources.<br><br>

                            Implementation of AI in agriculture for optimisation of irrigation and application of pesticides and herbicides</a>
                        <p class="description"> <br>The population is increasing tremendously and with this increase the demand of food and employment is also increasing. 
                            The traditional methods which were used by the farmers, were not sufficient enough to fulfill these requirements.
                            AI in agriculture has brought an agriculture revolution. This technology has protected the crop yield from various factors 
                            like the climate changes, population growth, employment issues and the food security problems. 
                            It also saves the excess use of water, pesticides, herbicides, maintains the fertility of the soil, 
                            also helps in the efficient use of man power and elevate the productivity and improve the quality.

                            Automation and digitization of agriculture using AI and internet of things</a>
                        <p class="description"> <br> 
                            In most of the countries where the expansion of cropland is merely impossible, agriculture automation has become the only option and is the need of the hour. 
                            When it comes to digitization and automation in agriculture, IoT and AI play a key role in every phase of farming activities during pre and post-harvest operations. 
                            Adoption of these technologies from crop monitoring to autonomous harvesting robots are slowly transforming agriculture and making the life of farmers easier and faster. 
                            Classification and object detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and their variants have made immense contributions in solving image recognition and automating agricultural activities.
                            IoT and AI-enabled products are becoming cost-effective and robust, their widespread adoption in the agricultural field is inevitable.

                            Application of AI techniques and robotics in agriculture: A review</a>
                        <p class="description"> <br>
                            The applications of various AI techniques for cultivation, monitoring, and harvesting phases are provided in a systematic way to understand the development in the field. 
                            In addition to this, the application of various agriculture robots and modern devices is also highlighted for intelligent farming processes. 
                            The application of robots and autonomous systems in farming has raised the standard of farming and becoming more popular. 
                            The AI techniques provide data frequently in a real-time manner, leading to avoiding human errors and improving decision-making capabilities. 
                            From the rigorous review, AI approaches and modern types of equipment perform better than traditional practices with a minimum human effort at the minimum required time. 
                            AI techniques have been applied majorly to solving path planning problems of the agriculture robot rather than core agricultural activities of the cultivation, monitoring, and harvesting phases. 
                            The contribution of AI is significantly more in the monitoring phase and less in the harvesting phase, followed by the cultivation phase. 
                            AI techniques have been used particularly in simulation work, so there is a need to develop them for more real-time implementations.

                        Enabling smart agriculture by implementing AI and embedded sensing</a>
                    <p class="description"> <br>
                        The increasing demand of smart agriculture has led to the significant growth and development 
                            in the field of crop estimation and prediction improving its productivity. 
                            The analysis of crop age status is very important to prevent the excessive fertilization, 
                            understand the proper time to harvest and reduce the production cost. 
                            Image based analysis using computational intelligence have proved beneficial in estimation of categorical age in the crops.
                            The wheat crop is initially subjected to HSI color normalization, followed by the optimization process using genetic algorithm (GA) 
                            and artificial neural network (ANN) based prediction and crop precision status classification, 
                            which based optimized approach can significantly differentiate between the wheat crops from the other unwanted plants and weeds 
                            while identifying the crop yield age into categorical classes. The outcomes obtained for the experimentation yields the highest validation accuracy of 97.75% 
                            with the minimized error rate of 0.22 and a decrease of 0.28 in the loss value.

                        AI Naturalists Might Hold the Key to Unlocking Biodiversity Data in Social Media Imagery</a>
                    <p class="description"> <br> 
                        The increasing availability of digital images, coupled with sophisticated AI techniques for image classification, 
                        presents an exciting opportunity for biodiversity researchers to create new datasets of species observations. 
                        The study found over 60,000 geolocated images tagged with the keyword “flower” across an urban and rural location in the UK and classified these using AI, 
                        reviewing these identifications and assessing the representativeness of images. Images were predominantly biodiversity focused, showing single species. 
                        Non-native garden plants dominated, particularly in the urban setting. 
                        The AI classifier performed best when photos were focused on single native species in wild situations but also performed well at higher taxonomic levels (genus and family), 
                        even when images substantially deviated from this.
